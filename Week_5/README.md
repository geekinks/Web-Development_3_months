⚡ JavaScript Mastery Syllabus — Learn by Doing (Step-by-Step)

Each topic = small demo → micro challenge → reflection — building toward a real interactive website.

Part 1: JavaScript Foundations

1️⃣ Intro & Course Overview

What is JavaScript, and why does every web developer need it?

Hands-on: print “Hello, World” in the browser console.

2️⃣ JavaScript: What? Why? How?

Link JS to an HTML page (<script> tag).

Mini project: display an alert or log a message on button click.

3️⃣ Working with the DOM (HTML)

Select & modify HTML elements with JS (document.querySelector).

Challenge: change heading text and color when a button is clicked.

4️⃣ Data Types & Working with Strings

Numbers, Strings, Booleans.

Challenge: prompt user for a name and greet them dynamically.

5️⃣ Operators & Expressions

+, -, *, /, %, and string concatenation.

Challenge: build a tiny calculator.

6️⃣ Variables

let, const, var — when and why to use each.

Challenge: swap two variable values without errors.

7️⃣ Objects & Arrays

How to store structured data.

Challenge: make a list of favorite colors, display the 2nd one.

Part 2: Control & Interaction

1️⃣ Functions & Scope

Create reusable code blocks.

Challenge: write a function that doubles a number.

2️⃣ Event Handlers

Add click and input interactivity.

Challenge: make a button that changes the page background color.

3️⃣ Conditionals

if, else if, else, and comparison operators.

Challenge: greet users differently based on time of day.

4️⃣ Loops

for, while, for...of.

Challenge: print numbers 1–10, then show only even numbers.

Part 3: Modern JavaScript

1️⃣ Fetch API

Get real data from an API.

Challenge: fetch and display a random quote.

2️⃣ Promises & Async/Await

Handle asynchronous tasks.

Challenge: simulate a loading state before showing data.

3️⃣ Map & Filter

Work with arrays efficiently.

Challenge: filter even numbers, map them to squares.

4️⃣ Destructuring & Spread Syntax

Extract and merge data neatly.

Challenge: copy and extend an object or array.

5️⃣ Debugging & Error Handling

Use try...catch and DevTools.

Challenge: intentionally trigger and handle an error.

6️⃣ Modules, Import & Export

Organize code into reusable files.

Challenge: export a utility function and import it elsewhere.

✅ Final Project

Goal: Build a small interactive web app (e.g., a “Random Quote Generator” or “To-Do List”) using everything learned — DOM, functions, events, async data, and styling with CSS.
